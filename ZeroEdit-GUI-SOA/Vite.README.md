# Getting Started with Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page reloads when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Bundles the app for production into the `dist` folder.  
It uses ESBuild to optimize and minify your code for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally so you can preview the build before deployment.
